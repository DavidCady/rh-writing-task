The Installation section of this Quick Start Guide provides the basic information for installing and configuring ownCloud server for the purpose of creating a user account that can be accessed from a client. 

This guide assumes a single-server installation, which is appropriate for small workgroups and departments. In this type of deployment the following are hosted on one machine:


- The application server
- The web server
- The database server
- Storage 

Authentication is performed using an LDAP or Active Directory Server.

In this guide, installation is performed using the ownCloud Docker image because this is the quickest installation method. For other installation options see the *ownCloud Server Admin Manual*.
