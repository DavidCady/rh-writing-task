The Installation section of this Quick Start Guide provides the basic information for installing and configuring ownCloud server for the purpose of creating a user account that can be accessed from a client. For more detailed installation instructions see the *ownCloud Server Admin Manual*.

This guide assumes a single-server installation, which is appropriate for small workgroups and departments. In this type of deployment the following are hosted by one machine:


- The application server
- The web server
- The database server
- Storage 

Authentication is performed using an LDAP or Active Directory Server.
